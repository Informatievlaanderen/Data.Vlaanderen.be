            <h2 class="h2">1. Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                We explain how the OSLO-STEPS descriptions and composition
                methods -- introduced <a href="./linked_sources_overview.html">here</a> -- have been applied to and influenced by
                the concrete use cases of the project. Specifically, how the concrete paths and steps
                can be translated into the OSLO-STEPS format, which adjustments
                we made to the Semantic Workflow Processor (SWP) to ensure scalability, and how we added user feedback to the SWP API.
            </p>

        <div class="h2_alinea">
            <h2 class="h2">2. Translate Procedures into OSLO-STEPS</h2>
            <p>
                In the project we describe the use case “onboarding in a new municipality”. One part
                of that use case is the declaration of the new address. As showcase, an existing
                online form: <a href="https://eloket.antwerpen.be/nl/eloket/aangifte-adreswijziging-v3/">Change address Antwerp</a> is
                manually translated into OSLO-STEPS. A snippet is found in Listing 1, 2, and 3,
                where the OSLO-STEPS descriptions are split up in steps, states, and shapes.

                To summarize: steps are grouped within three levels: journey level, container level,
                and component level steps. Each step requires a set of states and produces a set of
                states (Listing 1). Each state describes a piece of data, and is linked to a SHACL
                shape (Listing 2). Each SHACL shape describes the constraints of a piece of data, to
                make sure all data can be validated (Listing 3). More details are described in

                <p>
                    Steps can be described in different levels of
                    granularity. As a result of our first tests, we introduced three levels: journey level,
                    container level and component level. Journey level steps have subpaths containing
                    container level steps, and container level steps have subpaths containing component
                    level steps. In an initial version we only had very fine grained step descriptions which could then
                    be combined. This solution turned out to be not very practical because of two
                    reasons:

                        the user is about to complete. If this results in very long workflows of very fine
                        grained steps, it is difficult for the user to have an overview.

                        guarantee decent performance, especially when many steps are independent
                        of each other. For example, if we have 6 input steps which all provide
                        information for a seventh step which depends on it, the SWP internally takes
                        maximally 6! = 720 alternative workflows into account. When we group these
                        six input steps, e.g., into two groups of three, the SWP internally takes
                        maximally 2! + 3! + 3! = 14 alternative workflows into account. Although this
                        does not affect the total resulting number of workflows, it significantly affects
                        performance.

                        Typically, a single online form can be viewed as a two-step process: filling in all the
                        data, and submitting the data. That is why in Listing 1 there are two journey level
                        steps: <strong>step:collectAddressChangeData</strong> and <strong>step:declareAddressChange</strong>.
                        The first journey level step requires an o-steps:emptyState and the final journey
                        level step produces your goal state: state:addressChangeDeclared.

                    <p>
                        For ease of use by users, make sure you add a descriptive label via the construct
                        <strong>o-steps:hasDescription [ xl:literalForm "[ENTER STEP LABEL

                        If the intermediate data is processed and the online form would contain multiple
                        sections, each section could be viewed as a journey level step. If it is not processed,
                        each section of the form could also be seen as a container level step (see Section
                        2.2.3)

                    <p>
                        A component level step can be seen as the lowest level form or interaction element.
                        Each such element is typically used to request data to fill in a specific state. In this
                        section, we assume that the full list of states is not known yet, and thus, component
                        level steps and states are typically identified concurrently. If the full list of states is
                        known, you can proceed to Section 2.2.3 and apply it to component level steps.
                    </p>
                    <br/>
                    <p>
                        A state can be seen as a piece of data that we know about the user. To be
                        future-proof, it is best practice to keep the individual states as fine-grained as
                        possible. For example: split between first name and last name. Which granularity to
                        choose depends on the use case (e.g., is it needed to split up the birth date in
                        day/month/year or not), best practices in data modeling, and which ontologies are
                        reused (Listing 2). In FAST, we have chosen to be maximally compliant with existing
                        OSLO vocabularies, by reusing the OSLO vocabularies where possible. This is
                        verifiable by inspecting the shapes (Listing 3): the <strong>sh:path</strong> properties for the
                        constraints are mostly based on OSLO vocabularies.
                    </p>
                    <br/>
                    <p>
                        As a currently identified best practice, we identify each data element at its lowest
                        granularity to be a component level step. For example, the “E-mailadres” form
                        element translates into a <strong>step:provideEmail</strong> step, and produces the
                        <strong>state:citizenEmailAddress</strong> state. As such, we can go over the entire online
                        form to identify each individual form element and associate a step and which state it
                        produces to it.
                    </p>
                    <br/>
                    <p>
                        Where feasible, existing steps should be reused as much as possible. It is highly
                        likely that the <strong>step:provideEmail</strong> step and associated state will be reusable
                        across forms. As such, it is beneficial to reuse this step and state.

                    <p>
                        The aforementioned best practice of identifying each data element at its lowest
                        granularity for steps is not a hard requirement: it is possible to, e.g., group the
                        <strong>state:citizenFirstName</strong> and <strong>state:citizenLastName</strong> states into a single
                        step:provideFullName step. More on grouping in Section 2.2.3

                        In Listing 1, we chose to literally translate the grouping of the online form into the
                        container level steps. For example, the <strong>step:provideNewAddress</strong> step produces
                        <strong>state:streetname, state:postcode, state:streetNumber</strong> etc. By producing
                        multiple states, you effectively group multiple states into a single step.

                    <p>
                        This flexibility of grouping (on all levels) allows you to influence the UX, and e.g.,
                        make changes for A/B testing. As such, optimal grouping and nesting of steps is

                        Each state gets associated with two types of metadata: a human-readable label, and
                        a link to a SHACL shape. When the full list of states is known, you can associate
                        SHACL shapes to describe the format of the data elements. These SHACL shapes
                        can be used to guide the UI generation, and validate the (submitted) data to make
                        sure the Semantic Web application can correctly interpret and process the submitted
                        data.

                        classified as a <strong>o-persoon:Inwoner</strong> should have at least one <strong>schema:email</strong> path of
                        which the string matches a specific pattern. These SHACL shapes could be used to
                        further detail the UX, e.g., by automatically deducting that entering the email address
                        is required, and each entered email address is validated using the pattern.

                    resolved. Specifically, we introduced step levels (Section 3.1) and increased

                    <p>
                        Without step levels, the SWP creates paths that start from the initial (typically empty)
                        state and end at the goal state in a single process. As this does not scale well and
                        deteriorates user experience (see Section 2.1), we introduce step levels (journey,
                        container, and component). As such, workflow composition becomes a multi-process
                        system: as long as you are not dealing with component level steps, you first invoke
                        the SWP to calculate the subpaths in a lower level. When starting with a journey level step,
                        first you ask the subpath consisting of container level steps, then you ask
                        the subpath consisting of component level steps.

                            The subgoal needs to be explicitly stated to ensure that the result of the subpath

                        <p>
                            The input data structure needs to be derived to ensure that a valid subpath can be
                            found without taking the previous steps into account. For example, if a container
                            level step requires to know the personal information of a citizen before the address
                            change can be requested, the structure of a citizen’s personal information needs to
                            be derived based on the prior relevant container level steps. Without deriving this
                            structure and using it as input for the subpath computation, the SWP cannot
                            calculate any subpath because the required inputs are not discoverable.
                        </p>
                        <br/>
                        <p>
                            To make sure the subpaths are still optimal, the costs of each step are taken into
                            account. Each step has costs of different types: these costs are the limit values for
                            the goal. The SWP’s algorithm ensures that each step’s execution cost is within the
                            described limits. For example, when a container level step has a cost of 200 for a
                            specific cost type such as Duration, it is ensured that the sum of all subpath steps
                            remains lower than 200. By reusing these costs when calculating the subpaths, we
                            make sure each subpath’s execution cost is also within the limits of the original step.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Once we additionally derived the subgoal and input data structure, the SWP can
                            calculate the subpath for each step based on the preselected higher-level steps, the
                            subgoal, the input data structure, and the user-specific profile information. This
                            process is the same for subpath calculation of both journey and container level
                            steps.

                    <p>
                        Due to use case testing, we introduced some general improvements for the
                        performance: taking only relevant steps into account when calculating paths (Section
                        3.2.1), ensuring each step only needs to be completed once (Section 3.2.2), ignoring
                        permutations of independent steps (Section 3.2.3).
                    </p>

                        <h4 class="h4">3.2.1 Preselection step</h4>
                        <p>
                            Based on the input data structure and step description, we can derive a subset of
                            relevant steps before we calculate the actual path. For example, if we can derive that
                            a procedure does not request any data about a citizen’s pets, we can ignore all steps that handle pet data.
                            This lowers the number of steps that are taken into account
                            during path calculation and lowers computation time for the SWP.
                        </p>
                        <br/>
                        <p>
                            This preselection step can also be used when calculating the subpaths. First, the
                            steps are divided into journey, container, and component level steps, because when
                            calculating a journey level subpath, you only need to take container level steps into
                            account. Then, based on the derived input data structure, the divided steps can be
                            further filtered to exclude steps that cannot handle the derived input data structure.

                        <p>
                            To adhere to the Once-Only Principle (OOP), we modified the SWP in such a way
                            that workflows include each step once at most. This is very helpful for the FAST use
                            cases, as FAST’s use cases typically handle life events: data is modified because
                            the environment is modified (e.g., moving between cities). In these types of use
                            cases, each step only needs to be completed once. By making sure each step is
                            only taken into account once, we lower the number of relevant steps for each path
                            calculation and lower computation time for the SWP.
                        </p>
                        <br/>
                        <p>
                            This modification remains configurable, as there are other types of use cases where
                            certain steps need to be completed multiple times.

                        <p>
                            When many steps are independent of each other and we solely rely on ordered lists
                            of steps, many alternative workflows can be created, e.g., “fill in first name then last
                            name” and “fill in last name then first name” are two different workflows, whereas “fill
                            in first name and last name” is only one workflow. The combinatorial explosion
                            decreases performance of the SWP, e.g., five independent steps result in 120
                            alternative workflows.

                        <p>
                            We modified the original path algorithm to derive which steps are independent of
                            each other (i.e., when their required input states do not overlap), and if so, return
                            these steps in an unordered instead of ordered list. As such, five independent steps
                            result in a single workflow (or subpath). As such, we provide meaningful options
                            whilst guaranteeing performance.

                <p>
                    It is important for the user (in our use case, the citizen) to see which data is used,
                    especially when specific steps submit data to third parties. To improve user
                    experience, we included support in the SWP. For each step, the user can now ask
                    which concrete data is taken into account that will also be the data which is
                    submitted to third parties. Specific documentation on this feedback loop is available
                    at the <a href="https://fast.ilabt.imec.be/docs/server/0.9.0/#producing-info-used-by-a-step">SWP documentation</a>.

                <h2 class="h2">5. Conclusion</h2>
                <p>
                    We discussed the application of a use case to the SWP. Specifically,
                    Section 2 details some best practices on how to manually create well-structured
                    OSLO-STEPS descriptions to be used by the SWP. Separate from the fact that the
                    SWP successfully handled the given use cases, some general performance
                    enhancements emerged.
                </p>
                <br/>
                <p>
                    First, the usage of step levels increases performance and user experiences, and
                    allows for more advanced configuration of the UX. In this project, three levels of
                    steps seemed sufficient and was implemented using a preprocessing step. However,
                    when needed, more advanced nesting could be designed.
                </p>
                <br/>
                <p>
                    Second, it became clear that limiting the options greatly improves the performance of
                    the SWP. We saw this when optimizing the performance: nesting the steps, filtering
                    on only relevant steps, limiting each step to be executed only once, and disallowing
                    permutations all greatly reduced the amount of (equivalent) workflow alternatives,
                    and improved performance. As such, additional preprocessing steps to further filter
                    the set of irrelevant options could be proven to be beneficial.
                </p>
                <br/>
                <p>
                    Moreover, these additional preprocessing steps are dependent on the OSLO-STEPS
                    descriptions and thus need to be calculated each time the descriptions change,
                    however, they are not dependent on the user information taken into account when
                    calculating the (sub)paths. As such, these preprocessing steps need not influence
                    the processing time when a user asks for a personalized workflow, as they can be
                    implemented to only influence the update time when the OSLO-STEPS descriptions
                    change.
