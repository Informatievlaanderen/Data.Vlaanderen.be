                We describe the different data sources and data formats which are taken into account when composing workflows. We furthermore explain, how these
                formats relate to each other and how we translate between different relevant formats.

            <p>
                The planning process makes use of (i) public service steps descriptions in OSLO-STEPS, (ii) step related cost information, and (iii) information and about the 
                user. In the following we will describe each of the three components and then introduce the internal step representation in N3 utilized by the workflow planner.

            <p>
                The following concepts of the data model are relevant for the planning process: Steps, states and 
                state shapes. In the following these concepts are briefly described, a full documentation is available <a href="https://fast.ilabt.imec.be/ns/oslo-steps/index-en.html">here</a>. 
                Additionally listing 1 shows an example to illustrate how steps are represented in OSLO-STEPS.
            </p>
            <br/>
            <h3 class="h4">Steps</h3>
            <p>
                A step is an action which can be performed in a workflow. Each step can only be
                executed if certain conditions are fulfilled (pre condition) and each step leads to a
                new situation (post condition). We describe these conditions and the resulting
                situation on terms of so-called states. In the example in Listing 1, we see the
                description of the step confirmAddressChange. This description refers to the visit
                of a policeman which is required in Belgium if a citizen wants to change his address.
                The step can only be executed, if the address change is declared and after the visit
                of the policeman, the change is confirmed.
            </p>
            <br/>
            <p>
                Steps can be described at different levels of granularity. We can for example
                understand the act of providing personal information like name, date of birth and
                national number as one big step or we can see giving each of these details as small
                single steps. It depends on the particular use case, how fine-grained the steps need
                to be and in our project, we need different levels of granularity. We therefore decided
                to introduce different hierarchy levels: component level, container level and journey
                level. Workflows can be composed on each of these levels. The step displayed in
                Listing 1 is a component level step, that is the lowest level in our representation and
                the step can not be split up in smaller steps any more.

            <h3 class="h4">States</h3>
            <p>
                Pre and post conditions of steps are described as states. States are representations
                of situations. In the context of steps, these situations can either be requirements to
                execute a step or they can be the result of such an execution. In our format each
                state has a URI and thus can have meta information. A state furthermore has one or
                more state shapes assigned which further describe it. Additionally it can have UI
                shapes which are used to specify the data format an answer is expected to be
                provided in.
            </p>
            <br/>
            <p>
                In Listing 2 we provide the example of a state declaration. The state
                <i>state:addressChangeDeclared</i> is a state in the OSLO vocabulary and it has 
                the shape <i>shape:addressChangeDeclaredShape</i> associated to it as a state
                shape.

            <h3 class="h4">State and UI shapes</h3>
            <p>
                Shapes specify how the triples representing a state should look like. Here, we use
                the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/shacl/">SHape Constraints Language (SHACL)</a>. With SHACL we can describe the
                syntactic shape of a triple or a set of triples. This for includes specifying the
                predicates which for a certain node need to have values, but also the specific kind of
                values (string following a certain pattern, integer within a range, etc.).
                
            </p>
            <br/>
            <p>
                It depends on the intended use of the shape which kind of information it should
                contain. While for our workflow composition process it is very important whether or
                not certain kinds of triples are valid at a certain point in time, for the user interface it
                is much more important how the data needs to be represented, it should for example
                be excluded that users can enter negative ages or order a negative amount of
                tickets. For the needs of the project, we defined two different kinds of shapes: UI
                shapes contain the information which is relevant for the UI, state shapes contain the
                information our internal representation format needs.
            </p>
            <br/>
            <p>
                In Listing 3 we display an example state shape. In order to obtain the state the
                shape is associated to, for each instance of the class o-persoon:Inwoner there
                needs to be a triple with the predicate ex:addressChangeDeclared and the object
                true. This state shape is special in the sense that the information it provides are
                also interesting from a UI point of view and could therefore also be used as a UI
                shape. We do not only state that a certain triple needs to exist (sh:minCount 1), we
                even specifically state its value and that value is a constant. In practice, most state shapes are 
                declaring the existence of certain triples since our composition relies on the dependencies of data based on triple level.

            <p>
                Next to the required and produced state of a step, we also need to express its
                weights. Weights are quantitative values expressing some kind of cost of the step.
                Costs can for example be the time which is spend executing a step or the actual
                money (if any) you need to pay in order to execute the step.
            </p>
            <br/>
            <p>
                In general, the costs of a step are use case dependent and our implementation can
                handle steps as long as the mechanism how the costs need to be combined is
                clearly defined - we for example calculate the overall cost of a workflow as the sum
                of the costs of its different steps. To declare costs we defined the predicate
                cost:cost which can have several subpredicates. In our current implementation we
                work with the costs cost:usersatifaction - here we give a value between 0 and
                1 where 0 is very unhappy and 1 is satisfied, the values can be multiplied to get the
                overall value for a workflow - cost:duration - here we measure the time a step
                takes, the value is added - cost:success - here we capture the likelihood that a
                step leads to the desired result - and cost:monetaryCost - here we measure
                actual costs in Euro which are up to now not that relevant in our current
                implementation.
            </p>
            <br/>
            <p>
                We display an example use of the cost vocabulary in Listing 4. The step of
                confirming an address change by the police normally takes 2 weeks (10160
                minutes), the visit is free (0 monetary costs), 97% of the users are satisfied by that
                step and in 98% of the cases the step is executed as accepted (i.e. there is a
                policeman visiting the place).

            <p>
                Another important component for the planning process is the information about users
                which is considered for workflow personalization, i.e. optimal steps and step
                sequence per user. In the context of the FAST project, such information is assumed
                to reside in a trusted location, e.g. in the MijnBurgerprofiel database maintained by
                the government in Flanders.
            </p>
            <br/>
            <p>
                Additionally, user information can be used to determine the state in which users are,
                i.e. which information is already provided and hence which steps are unnecessary to
                execute. Listing 5 shows information of a user. Where possible, we use existing
                vocabularies like <a href="http://xmlns.com/foaf/spec/">foaf</a> or <a href="https://schema.org/">schema.org </a>. In the example, we already have the
                name, the national number and the cell phone number of the user and can therefore
                omit the steps which are in place to acquire that information.

                Taking up the example provided above, the step step:confirmAddressChange is
                never necessary if the profile of the user already contains the information that the
                address change has been confirmed by the police.

                In order to compose workflows, we rely on an internal representation format. This
                representation format makes use of <a href="https://www.w3.org/TeamSubmission/n3/">Notation3 Logic (N3)</a> 
                an extension of the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/turtle/">RDF turtle</a> format which was used for OSLO-STEPS. N3 allows the user to cite
                graphs, to write logical rules and to use several built-in functions to for example
                calculate numbers or directly operate on strings. N3 is also the language the
                workflow composer itself is written in which also makes the format a natural choice to represent possible steps in workflows. 
                However, we opted to introduce an alternative data format (OSLO-STEPS) to represent possible steps of a workflow in this project.
                This has two reasons, firstly, we wanted to have a format which is as close as
                possible to the other formats designed in the OSLO framework such that users used
                to these other formalisations can easily adapt, secondly, we did not want to use a
                non-standard syntax (N3 logic is no W3C recommendation but only a possible
                candidate) since - based on our experience - that can stop potential users from
                actually using the specification. As we will explain later, OSLO-steps can automatically be translated to our internal format such that every
                potential user can freely choose which format he or she wants to use in order to
                describe possible steps of workflows. In this section, we introduce our internal
                representation format, in the next section, we further elaborate how the translation
                between the formats is done.
            </p>
            <br/>
            <p>
                The step description in our internal format is done using a backward-rule. In N3 we
                can state rules which act on linked data. These rules can either be stated as a
                forward rule (using the arrow "=>") or they can be stated as a backward rule (using
                "<="). From a model theoretic perspective, both kinds of rules have the same
                meaning, namely a logical implication, but from a procedural point of view, they
                differ: <a href="http://eulersharp.sourceforge.net/">The EYE reasoner</a> which we used in our implementation applies forward
                reasoning when a rule is stated in a forward manner and backward reasoning when
                we have a backward rule.

            </p>
            <br/>
            <p>
                In practice that means, that forward rules get applied on the initial knowledge till a
                goal is reached while backward-rules start from the goal and try to verify it based on
                rules and facts. In the context of our workflow engine which deals with data change,
                it must additionally be mentioned, that when applying forward reasoning, interim
                results get stored internally.

            </figure>
            <p>
                This is also the reason why our workflow composer only makes use of backward
                rules. The composer tries to find paths to a predefined goal. During that process,
                data can change and with these changes, the consequences of data can also get invalid.
                A step description in our internal format consists of different parts which are also
                displayed in Listing 6. Below, we discuss the meaning of these different parts:
            </p>
            <br/>
            <p>
                <strong>Map:</strong> Name of the map the step belongs to. We divide our step descriptions into
                different sets called “maps”. This distribution into maps is needed because rules can
                come from different sources and use the same vocabulary differently (even if
                standardization efforts as OSLO try to prevent that). Naming the corresponding map
                together with a step description helps us to control unintended interaction between
                steps from different maps.
            </p>
            <br/>
            <p>
                <strong>Step name:</strong> For each step we describe which data gets invalid by the execution of
                the step. This data is expressed by means of triples and surrounded by curly
                brackets {}. It can contain variables (starting with question marks ?), but all variables
                it contains also need to be present in the Where-part of the description. This has
                technical reasons, but since all data which can be removed also needs to be valid,
                this does not impose any limitations in expressiveness.                
            </p>
            <br/>
            <p>
                <strong>Between-part:</strong> As our steps have durations, it can be important to know what
                happens with our data after the execution of a step has started and before its
                execution is finished. This is expressed in the Between-part of the description. This
                between-part contains triples and from the syntactic point of view it has the exact
                same restrictions as the From-part. If we want to use new variables in that part of the
                description, these need to be declared in the Where-part of the description.               
            </p>
            <br/>
            <p>
                <strong>To-part:</strong> For each step we describe the situation the execution of the step causes.
                The same syntactic requirements we imposed on the Between-part of the step
                description also apply here.    
            </p>            
            <br/>
            <p>
                <strong>Where-part:</strong> For each step we describe the condition under which the step can be
                executed. This part of the description can also be used to do calculations (if the step
                changes or manipulates a value, it can be that the new value depends on the old
                one, here we need to calculate). For technical reasons (backward rules cannot
                contain new variables in their consequence) this part also needs to be used to 
                declare variables which are only used in the To- or in the Between-part of the
                description. For these a Skolem variable needs to be created, that is a unique URI
                which represents a resource. As we will discuss below, the reasoner we use can do
                that automatically.             
            </p>
            <br/>
            <p>
                <strong>Weights:</strong> The weights of a step in our internal description format are the analogue to
                the the costs as represented in OSLO-STEPS. Each step can have different kinds of
                weights like for example the monetary costs of its execution or their expected
                success rate. Weights assigned to a step using ourinternal format need to be
                aggregatable, i.e. there needs to be a method with which an overall value for a
                composed workflow can be computed making use of the singleton values of the
                different steps.
            </p>
            <br/>
            <p>
                Below, in Listing 7 we provide the description of the step
                step:confirmAddressChange which we also described above using the
                OSLO-STEPS vocabulary. The From-part and the Between- part are empty. The
                required state is represented in the Where-part of the description. The address
                change needs to be declared. Additionally, we have a triple declaring, that the
                requester of the address change needs to be a citizen (inwoner). The reason for that
                is that all the data we want to add about a person in our workflows needs to be
                related to the same instance, we thus need the unique uri of the citizen. 
                In the To-part of the listing, we see the produced state. The address change is
                confirmed by the police.

            <h2 class="h2">OSLO-STEPS as descriptive logic rules</h2>
            <p>
                As described above, we have an internal format we base our workflow composition
                on - this format is based on N3 - and we have the OSLO-STEPS vocabulary which is
                designed to be very close to existing OSLO vocabularies such that users who
                already know these standards do not have problems to write rules. To translate from
                one representation to the other, we defined rules. Below, we explain how these rules
                work in more detail.
            </p>
            <br/>
            <p>
                As explained above, with OSLO-STEPS we state for each stepe the required and the
                produced state and for these states we have shapes. For our implementation, we
                need to find these shape for each step and translate from SHACL to our pattern
                representation. We wrote different rules for different SHACL constructs. We
                exemplify that on shapes declaring that a value needs to exist. This is normally
                indicated by the predicate sh:mincount (see also listing 3). If for a path (sh:path) a
                sh:mincount value of 1 is given, that means that the target for which the shape is
                defined always needs to have at least one value connected to it via the predicate
                which appears after sh:path. The shape in Listing 3 for example states that for
                every citizen (o-persoon:Inwoner) x there needs to be a value for
                ex:addressChangeDeclared. This shape is even more explicit, the value needs to
                be true, this is indicated by the predicate sh:hasValue. We expect a triple of the
                form:
            </p>
            <br/>
            <p class="center_p"><strong>x ex:addressChangeDeclared true</strong></p>
            <br/>
            <p>
                In order to produce the above pattern based on the shape displayed in Listing 3, we
                employ a rule which detects the occurrences of such shape descriptions and
                produces the above mentioned pattern. We display the rule for that particular pattern
                in Listing 8. Next to the assignment of a concrete value for a predicate, our
                implementation also supports nested paths (i.e. if we have two predicates connecting
                the target with a node) and qualified value shapes. We plan to further expand our
                pattern creation mechanism.

                In the description in Listing 7 for which the address change is declared is the same
                instance for which the address change is confirmed. We thus need to internally
                represent the target of the shape as a constant which later on will need to be
                replaced by a variable.
            </p>

            <p>
                After assigning the expected pattern to each shape, our translation finds for each
                step description all states which are connected with the required state and all shapes
                which are connected with the produced shapes. It additionally takes all the declared
                costs into account. The produced shapes get translated to the To-part of the internal
                step representation format. The required shapes get translated to the Where-part of
                the step description since in our use cases there are no actions which make data
                invalid (this might changes if we get more complex use cases). To the Where-part of
                the internal representation format, we additionally add a triple declaring the target(s)
                for the shapes used - in our case all shapes are declared for instances of the class
                o-persoon:Inwoner - and where necessary, we add functions creating new uris for
                each variable which is used in the To-part of the step description but not in the
                where-part. This has technical reasons, as backward rules cannot have new
                variables in their consequence, we need to use this mechanism.

            <br/>
            <p>
                Our translation rules get executed by the EYE reasoner with which we can also
                produce variables for all instances in our var-namespace. From the different
                descriptions in Listings 1-4 with additional descriptions of the produced state, we for
                example produce the rule displayed in Listing 8.

                Next to the description of the different possible steps in our internal format and the
                description of the current situation as exemplified in Listing 5, we need one more
                information in order to start our workflow composition process, we need to declare
                the goal we want to achieve by the execution of the workflow.

            <p>
                We display an example of such a goal declaration in Listing 9. Each goal description
                contains the state we want to reach by executing the workflow (here, the address
                change needs to be confirmed) together with the limits for each weight. Here, we do
                to spend more than 4 weeks with the process, we do not want to pay more than 20
                Euros, we want to have a success rate of the entire workflow of at least 80% and the
                user satisfaction value should not go below 0.8.

            <p>
                We declare such limits for each workflow because of technical reasons. Since our
                workflow composition produces every possible workflow which reaches the goal and
                there can be many of such workflows, we limit the search space by declaring such
                limits. This does not only make it easier to produce the workflow, it also makes it
                easier for the other tolls depending on the workflow composition to choose from the
                workflows provided.
            </p>

        <div class="h2_alinea">
            <h2 class="h2">Workflow composition</h2>
            <p>
                Our workflow composer now takes the description of the initial situation (as
                exemplified in Listing 5), the different step descriptions using our internal format
                (Listing 7) and the goal to achieve (as in Listing 9) into account. The workflow can
                additionally make use of external rules which need to be stated in a backwards
                manner.
            </p>
            <br/>
            <p>
                Starting form the current situation, the composer produces all possible paths towards
                the goal which are within the stated limits. For each path the composer generates,
                the actual costs are calculated. For monetary costs and duration, the sum of all the
                steps included is taken, for success and comfort we take the product of all costs.                
            </p>
            <br/>
            <p>
                In Listing 10, we provide an example output of such a composition process. In order
                to have an address change confirmed, the user needs to provide personal
                information, information about the movement and the new address and he needs to
                request an address change which then needs to be confirmed by the police.
            </p>
            <br/>
            <p>
                In our example, we do not have alternative paths. This is because we wanted to
                keep the example for this document simple and understandable. Therefore, all paths
                are just permutations of each other. The last step, the confirmation of the address
                change always comes after the declaration, that is because these steps depend on
                each other.
            </p>
            <br/>
            <p>
                Next to each path, we also display the different costs. Based on the preferences of
                the user, different paths can be chosen based on the numbers. Depending on the
                information available, it can also be that some workflows are shorter for particular
                users. If we actually compose a workflow taking the information in Listing 4 into
                account, we can for example expect, the composed workflow does not contain a step 
                asking for personal information since in that case this information is already available
                in the database.

            <p>
                We explained how the OSLO-STEPS standard is used to describe
                steps and their workflows. By decoupling step descriptions from state and shape
                descriptions we make sure, that the latter can be reused for different descriptions.
            </p>
            <br/>
            <p>
                We furthermore showed, how OSLO-STEPS can be translated into our internal
                standard. By using linked data and semantic web reasoning, we also kept our
                implementation open for different standards which can be equally used and easily
                translated if they include the same kind of information.             
            </p>
            <br/>
            <p>
                As a last step, we briefly explained how the workflow composition
                itself is done. Here, we use backward reasoning in Notation3 Logic and the EYE
                reasoner. What could still be added to our formalisation is a format to state goals and
                workflow alternatives in a way which is compatible to OSLO-STEPS, we plan to do
                so in the future.
