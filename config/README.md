# Supporting private repositories

## (private) repository 'Generated'
The repository 'Generated' is the repository in which the toolchain will write the generated artifacts.
The objective is that any commit in this (publication) repository will lead to a commit in the repository 'Generated'.
To ensure that this commit can be pushed, a deploy key with write permissions must be created in the repository 'Generated'.
How to do that, consult the GitHub documentation. 
Since the commit is created and pushed from the CircleCI pipeline execution, one must configure the CircleCI project for this publication repository with the deploy key.

In short the steps are:
   - initialise an ssh key for the repository 'Generated' as deploy key
   - use the public part to create a deploy key with write permission in the repository 'Generated'
   - add the private part to the CircleCI project as an additional ssh key having as hostname "github.com".
   - The fingerprint of this private key should be placed in the .circleci/config in the create-artifact step configuration.
   

The last step injects the private ssh key into the create-artefact step and enable to execute write operations to the repository 'Generated'.

As this is fully deploy key based, the approach is agnostic to the visibility of the repository. It works for public and private repositories.


## private repository 'Thema'
When a source repository is private, then a similar approach as for the private repository 'Generated' should be followed.
However due to the key insertion of CIRCLECI into a container (step) the following has to be considered:

- create a new deploy key for the private 'Thema' repository
- enable the public key as deploy key for the 'Thema' repository (read access is sufficient)
- insert the private key in CIRCLECI project as additional ssh key with as (dummy) hostname Thema-private
- enable the update of the ssh configuration for this (dummy) hostname Thema-private
- use instead of `https://github.com/<ORG>/<REPO>` , `git@Thema-private:<ORG>/<REPO>.git` as  the value of the repository in the configuration of a publication point.

This has to be executed for each private repository.

# Editoral flow

## Used terminology

A *Thema repository* is a git repository containing all information that is related to a collection of specifications. A Thema repository may contain information about a single document, but usually  it contains several specifications that are managed together (natural goverance). There is no branching strategy imposed by the toolchain on a Thema repository. Consequently the origanisation and structure may differ from one to another. The toolchain, however, imposes the precence of the necessary information for each specification. Although there is a flexible configuration possible, the easiest to have it all setup is to initialize a new Thema repository from https://github.com/Informatievlaanderen/OSLOthema-template.  

A *publication point* refers to a specific state of the specification. This specific state is identified as a commit/branchtag of a Thema repository.

The *publication environment* (this repository) is a description of the publication state for a publication environment. The publication environment will contain a list of publication points describing the specifications that are published. 

The *generated repository* is the repository where the toolchain based on the configuration in the publication environment is writing its results. The generated repository is created in such a way that a proxy with the corresponding hostname can serve the repository as static website. 

The *toolchain* is the complete setup of an ecosystem of data repositories, operational guidelines, and software supporting the publication of the specifications. To have a low level adoption, the whole ecosystem relies on Open Source and free tier resources, except for the UML modeling tool. IT is future work to lift this last dependency. In some explainations the term can mean only the sequence of transformation steps that will create from the list of publication points a new published state in the generated repository.   

A *editor* of a specification is a person updating the content of a specification. This might be changing the semantical data model, but also the surrounding texts such as conformance statements, examples, the list of collaborators and the metadata about the specification. 

A *publication environment maintainer* is the person in charge of the global coherency of the publication environment. For instance that all specifications are correctly published at the right level of quality.

## Happy editorial flow 

The toolchain is setup with the intend to let editors focus on the publication of a specification. From the perspective of an editor, publishing a specification is the management of the set of publications points for a specification. For this the editor, updates the one of files containing publication points. Each commmit to the repository will trigger the processing of the publications points. When no blocking errors are present, a new state is written to the generated repository. Blocking errors can be inspected by reading the error report of the failed step in CIRCLECI, while non-blocking errors are written out to generated repository. 


## Publication points structure and organisation

Publication points are expressed as follows:

```
 {
        "urlref":"/doc/applicatieprofile/<SPECIFICATION>/<VERSION>",
        "repository":"https://github.com/<ORG>/<THEMA_REPOSITORY>",
        "branchtag":"<BRANCHTAG>",
        "name":"<SPECIFICATION_NAME>",
        "filename":"config/<SPECIFICATION>.json",
        "navigation":{
            "prev":"/doc/applicatieprofiel/<SPECIFICATION>/<VERSION>",
            "next":"/doc/applicatieprofiel/<SPECIFICATION>/<VERSION>"
        },
        "type" : "<PUBLICATIONPOINT_TYPE>",
        "disabled" : boolean
        "examples" : boolean
    },
```

### publication points fields

- *urlref* : the relative url on which the specification will be published. The absolute url is config.hostname + urlref. This is also the path where the specification is written to on the generated repository. This field is also considered the identifier of the publication point. No two publication points should have the same urlref.
- *repository* : the thema repository where the specification is stored. A template for the configuration is found in https://github.com/Informatievlaanderen/OSLOthema-template.  For public accessible repositories the http notation is preferred, while for private repositories the ssh notation should be used. 
- *branchtag*: the commit in the thema repository that is used to create the specification of. This is the most important field for an editor as this determines the result of the toolchain. It is intented to be commit hash or tag. This ensures that the generation process for this publication point always has the same content. When it is a commit hash or tag, reapplying the generation process by the toolchain will result in the same output. However, because git does not make a diffference between the command to fetch the content from a branch or commit/tag, the value can also be a branch. In that case regeneration of the  publication point is no guaranteed to result in the same output as a previous run. When the editor has added new information to the branch in the thema repository then the toolchain will fetch the latest content, and thus create a specification based on the latest content. This might be intended behaviour, but when dealing with versioned specification documents, this might be undesirable. To avoid unintended results, the recommendation is to use commit/tags.
- *filename* : the name of the config file in the thema repositorty containing the configuration of the specification that is the subject of this publication point. If omitted the filename defaults to `config/eap-mapping.json`
- *name* :  the name of the spefication in the filename. It should be the same name as used in the urlref (without the version). 
- *navigation*: a structure with a next or prev attribute containing a relative URL of a next or previous version of the specification
- *type*: the publication point type. Can be omitted for publication points that describe a document, it is used to create special variants of publication points.
- *disabled*: a boolean indicating if the the publication point should be processed. This is an aid when resolving conflicts between concurrent usage of the toolchain by multiple editors. Suppose one editor creates a publication point that leads to a processing error by the toolchain. It is this editor's responsability to resolve the issue. As long this issue is not resolved the whole toolchain is blocked for all other editors. To provide the editor sufficient time to resolve the issue and to deblock the other editors, the publication point can be disabled. This is a clean git source controlled operation and it can be executed by other editors, to deblock themselves. When the issue is resolved by the editor, the publication point can be reactivated again.
- *examples*: generate json-ld structures that can be used to create examples for the application profile

#### nameing conventions 
TODO


### variant 1 - by copy
This variant of the above publication point sidetracks the generation process from the original content
```
 {
        "urlref":"/doc/applicatieprofile/<SPECIFICATION>/<VERSION>",
        "repository":"https://github.com/<ORG>/<THEMA_REPOSITORY>",
        "branchtag":"<BRANCHTAG>",
        "name":"<SPECIFICATION_NAME>",
        "filename":"config/<SPECIFICATION>.json",
        "navigation":{
            "prev":"/doc/applicatieprofiel/<SPECIFICATION>/<VERSION>",
            "next":"/doc/applicatieprofiel/<SPECIFICATION>/<VERSION>"
        },
        "type" : "raw",               <-- fixed value 'raw' 
        "directory" : "urlref",       <-- a directory in the repository 
        "disabled" : boolean
    },
```
The toolchain will process this publication point by copying the content of directory in the repository at the branchtag to the urlref.
The expectation is that the structure and information is exactly equivalent to the generated structure resulting from the normal toolchain processing.


It might be used for several objectives:
  - speeding up the toolchain processing: copying is faster as the generation process
  - publishing manually created specifications
  - republishing specifications created by an older version of the toolchain. This is useful when upgrading the version of the toolchain.
  - ensuring that no accidental change happens to the specification. It is decoupling the publication point from its thema repository.

The generated repository is always in sync with the structural expectations of the generation process of the toolchain. It is thus a good candidate to take the information from.

The script `/scripts/turn2raw.sh` is a script that turns all publication points in a file to publication points of this type.

### variant 2 - versionless 
This variant expresses a reference from one path to another path
```
 {
        "urlref":"/doc/applicatieprofile/<SPECIFICATION>/",
        "seealso": "/doc/applicationprofile/<SPECIFICATION>/<VERSION>",
        "disabled" : boolean
        "type": "<SPECIFICATION_TYPE>"        <-- values are ap/voc

    },
```

#### variant 2 - publication points fields

- *urlref* : the relative url on which the specification will be published. The absolute url is config.hostname + urlref. This is also the path where the specification is written to on the generated repository.
- *seealso* : the source path from where the data is comming from
- *disabled*: a boolean indicating if the the publication point should be processed. 
- *type*: determines the type of the specification. Based on the type generated artifacts from this specification are copied to a common central place in the generated repository. Should match the type of the specification otherwise the toolchain processing will fail. 

#### variant 2 - implementation considerations
The reference is implemented in the toolchain as an internal copy. Therefore the content can only be updated when the source (seealso) is part of the execution process of the toolchain. 
The absence of the source will lead to a toolchain processing error.

This publication point supports the usecase for: 
  - versionless URLs for a specification
  - publication on different paths, in particulary for vocabularies with dereferenceable URIs. Usually these have a different URL location then the html representation of the application profiles or vocabularies. 


### Triggering an execution of the toolchain.
The toolchain is triggered one each commit in the publication environment. The publication environment is monitored by the CI/CD tool CIRCLECI. The impact and amount of work depends on the commit.

- A commit containing only a change to one or more publication points will lead to only processing those affected publication points. If the change in publication point will not lead to a change in the specification only the commit tag of this execution is changed.
- Any change to a file outside publication points will reprocess all publication points specified in the publication repository.

A change in a publication point is defined as a change in a value for a field w.r.t. the previous successful execution of the toolchain. 
Or as the addition or removal of a field to a publication point.
This last case becomes handy when the editors used branches instead of commit/tags for the branchtag field. Adding a field *dummy* and bumping a number in that one will trigger the toolchain execution. It avoids the search for a value commit hash or the creation of a tag while editing a specification.
The commit to the publication environment corresponding to the last successful execution is stored the generated repository.
So failed executions of the toolchain will accumulate the changes until an execution is successful. 

Sometimes it might be needed to reprocess the whole publication repository. For instance to cleanup the generated repository. The toolchain execution is an additive process: it adds or updates the content of directories and files in the generated repository. Deleting publication points from the generated repository can only be done by triggering a full rebuild. To initiate that process, the dummy file `/config/trigger.all` exists. This file is not a publication point file and thus a change to it will trigger a rebuild.


## Multi environment configuration

The publication points are stored in files with extension `publication.json`. Each file is a list of publication points. 

Over time, a single list containing publication points from many different thema repositories becomes hard to maintain.
Also, usually the are different stages of the publication environment: commonly there are a production, test and development environment.
The toolchain supports multiple environments by configuring for each environment a branch in the publication repository.
This multiple environment creates an additional maintenance challenge: namely to understand the difference between published publication points across environments.
Ideally, understanding the differences should be supported by the git source control tool.
 Github implements the notion of pull requests where a collection of changes can be propagated from one branch to another.  
Therefore the toolchain allows to organise the publication points in directories and many files. 

The toolchain supports 3 directories `/config/dev`, `/config/test` and `/config/prod` containing publication points files.
In the `/config/config.json`, the `pubicationpoints` defines which directories are taken into account for the generation process by the toolchain.
Default settings are for the branches:
- branch `production` : ['prod']
- branch `test`       : ['test', 'prod']
- branch `dev`        : ['dev', 'test', 'prod'] 
Using this setup the following guideline can be followed:
- publication points published on the production environment should be configured in the `/config/prod` directory
- publication points solely published on the test environment should be configured in the `/config/test` directory
- publication points solely published on the development environment should be configured in the `/config/prod` directory
In each directory one can have a file called `<thema>.publication.json` containing the publication points for that thema published in that environment.
Then if an editor is working on a specification in the development environment, the configuration of publication point in `/config/dev/<thema>.publication.json` is adapted.
When this work is finished, the editor removes the publication point from the file `/config/dev/<thema>.publication.js` and inserts it in to the file of the test environment on the development branch: `/config/test/<thema>.publication.js` . 
The removal is important as the toolchain assumes a unique identity for each publication point (see above). 
During the execution of the toolchain, a global list of to be processed publication points will be created and that assumes that a single occurance of each publication point.
When this is successful, the change in the file `/config/test/<thema>.publication.js` can be propagated to the test environment. 
On the test branch the same procedure can be applied to publish it on the production branch.


This setup also supports toolchain maintainers when propagating changes to layout or updates to the processing, as it much easier to create an incremental update and isolate problematic cases.



# Disaster recovery & operational resources 

The setup of the toolchain is designed to consume minimal amount of operational costs. As all activity is done through source version control, the maintainers of the toolchain the publication environment obtain a very resiliant system. The sole single point of failure is the source control system, in this case github. The generated repository is the history of the publication environment. Loosing access to this repository is not entirely critical as the complete state can be recreated from the publication repository. Similary loosing control of the publication environment is not critical as the generated repository contains the state of the publication environment the form of the result of the transformation process. 

More critical is loosing access to the thema repositories, as these contain the UML documents wich form the basis for the specifications. However with the necessary effort a UML document corresponding to the generated specification can be created.
